    Type 'quit' or 'exit' to leave the program.
    Type 'help' to go to the help screen.

[creation]
To write a new choose your own adventure story, create a plain text document in
which to type your story. Each page of the story needs a unique name. Begin
each page with a single line containing only the text "[pagename]" with no
extra spaces at the beginning or end of the line. After this line, write the
contents of the page; these will be displayed exactly as you typed, except for
any links contained in that page.
